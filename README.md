# ROSEscript

**Rose Software** is a software that contains comprehensive aircraft data. This project aims to streamline the process of loading and parsing the `.txt` output files generated by Rose Software and converting them into readable and structured `.csv` files for easy visualization and analysis. The project is designed to save significant manhours (at least 2-3 days) that would otherwise be required to manually process and split each file individually. By automating this process, the data becomes readily available for visualization, allowing teams to focus on analysis rather than data preparation.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to:
1. **Load and Parse Data**: The project loads the `.txt` output files from Rose Software and converts them into `.csv` format for easy readability.
2. **Splitting Data**:
   - Split the data by different flights.
   - Further classify the data into **ground data** and **flight data** for each flight.
3. **Data Visualization**: The project enables the visualization of parsed data through:
   - Time series graphs for flight performance monitoring.
   - Bar plots for asset monitoring.
4. **GUI Integration**: A simple GUI is included to help streamline the process, providing an easy way to:
   - Load `.txt` files.
   - Parse and convert them to `.csv`.
   - Display necessary visualizations.

## Features

- **Automatic Flight Data Splitting**: The software automatically splits the raw `.txt` data into individual flights, converting each segment into structured `.csv` files.
- **Ground vs Flight Data**: Data is further classified into ground and flight phases for better analysis.
- **Simple and Intuitive GUI**: A user-friendly GUI allows easy navigation through the data loading, conversion, and visualization steps.
- **Visualization**: Supports time-series graphs and bar plots for data monitoring after the data is parsed and converted.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3 and a few libraries installed. Here's how to get started:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Loading Data**: Use the GUI to select the folder containing the`.txt` files generated by Rose Software.
2. **Processing Data**: The script will automatically parse the `.txt` files, split the data into flights, and classify them into ground and flight data.
3. **Converting Data**: The parsed data will be saved as `.csv` files for further analysis.
4. **Visualize Data**: Use the GUI to generate time-series graphs or bar plots based on the parsed and converted `.csv` data for easy monitoring and analysis.
